# Address Normalization

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive address normalization system tailored specifically for 
Pakistani addresses. The system will transform addresses from diverse formats into a standardized structure that adheres to 
predefined guidelines and rules. By achieving consistency and uniformity in address data, the project aims to enhance data quality,
facilitate efficient address matching, enable precise geocoding, and simplify address-based searches and analysis.
